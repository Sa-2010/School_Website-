        <div class="line"></div>
        <p>INGS is committed to provide much more than mere transmission of information and skills acquired through compartmentalized syllabi. True education begins ith knowing and understanding the child. At INGS we focus on overall development of the child i.e. Body, Mind and Soul; that helps create compassionate world citizens. <br /><br />Social environment plays a vital role in moulding child's future. Therefore, environment at INGS is defined by creating a culture that permits learners to express his/herself and provide stimuli for aesthetics development of senses to focus on extracurricular activities along with intellect. A positive environment helps to build enduring relationship with themselves and the world around them.<br /><br />INGS recognises each child as an individual being with his/her own special set of strengths and talents.<br /><br />This process begins with knowing the worth of others and one's own limitless abilities to learn and to achieve; and not with standardized achievement and comparison with others. At INGS, children have the freedom and independence to explore, to experiment and to discover during their learning process. It helps develop a character that learns with dignity and self-worth, for oneself and for the world.</p>

        <h1>Vision</h1>
        <div class="line"></div>
        <p>Infinite possibilities can be created through change in education. Positive development of children is possible through daily learning - be it through discovery of the self, of the life cycle of a honey bee, of the law of motion or of the speed and precision with which communication systems are established. Our vision is to establish a school that nurtures a learning culture which believes in and breathse change to education.<br /><br />Learning for children in the discovery of the self and a yearning to share that discovery with peers, teachers and parents. Our aspiration as a school is to provide much more than mere syllabi and examination oriented education. It is to help children become happy and responsible citizens of the global community.<br /><br />Isaac Newton Global School is a tribute to the English natural philosopher, generally regarded as the most original and influential theorist in the history of science; Sir Isaac Newton</p>
